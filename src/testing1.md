# This is a test for a seperate repo

I have a problem. A very serious problem. Something that has plagued me for most of my life. 

There have been times where I think I have finally gotten my problem beat, just for it to come back in full force.

What is my problem?

Is it drinking too much? Well that sure is one of my problems, but I'm not going to talk about that here.
~
Is it depression? Well, again, that sure is one of my problems, but there is absolutely no way I'm going to talk about *that* here.

Is it < insert whatever you want to project here >? No probably not! Unless of course you wanted to project your terrible procrastination, because * ding ding * that is what I am going to talk about here.

You must be thinking. Oh the drama! Not procrastination! It could not be a more horrible fate! * ends sarcasm * 

Well my judgmental reader, this is going to be about procrastination and not just any type of procrastination. This is going to be about *my* type of procrastination. 

We all procrastinate. Some more than others. It is nothing special nor will it ever be. What *is* intresting is the reason we procrastinate and much much more importantly why I procrastinate.

I have thought a lot recently about why I put off doing things. Why? Because I have goals and dreams that have been put on the back burner for so long. 

8 years give or take, I've been trying to put something out into the world. Not anything crazy mind you, but something.

I've attempted at least 3 startups with peers and have built countless prototypes myself. Yet, when I'm so close to finishing and releasing a product I stop or shift intrest.

Why? Well I wish I could say I knew why, but I don't know why. I can only guess.

This, right here, is my best guess..

But first I have to admit something to you, my dearest reader... this article is not for you. * gasp! * I know. I'm sorry. 

This article is for me. This article is my self diagnosed perscription for *my* kind of procrastination. 

I fear failure.

I fear failure so much, my body will refuse to even start.

But I'm tired of that. So this article is for me. 

I was never a very good writter.

But this article is out there now, poor grammer and all.

And you know what?

This is a start.

Writer's Note:

How did I not curse once through this entire thing?

Shit! Fuck! Damn!

Much better :)
